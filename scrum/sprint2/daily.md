# Daily Scrums

## 12/1/24

Participants: Full group

Found the issue with running the application to be tied to user access. 

Agreed that we'd get everything finished for this current sprint by 12/3.

## 12/3/24

Participants: Adam, Sarah and Moe

Moe was having some trouble getting the database to work on his computer, so we've reassigned the remaining tasks. Sarah will wrap up the admin dashboard, while Moe starts working on testing.

RJ has made progress on US4 but it seems to be a bigger task than just what one person should be on, so the rest of us will help work on it during the next sprint.
