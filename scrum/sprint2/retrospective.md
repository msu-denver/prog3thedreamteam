# Sprint Retrospective

Date/Time: 12/4/24

Participants: Full group

US5 was completed, and the backend for US2+3 was completed. The admin dashboard still needs to be done, but since it's a relatively easy task, we'll be putting it in the next sprint. 

US4 ended up being more complicated than was originally thought, so it'll be the main coding focus for the next sprint.
