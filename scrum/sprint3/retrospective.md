# Sprint Retrospective

Date/Time: 12/7/24

Participants: Full group

All user stories have been completed. 
We ran into some problems getting the dockerfile to work correctly near the end, so it would be a good idea to start that sooner on future projects.

We discovered an issue in the index.html code that only effects the first item on the menu for admin and customers alike. This would be an issue that would be addressed if there were additional sprints. We would have also liked to implement item quantities to the cart and a SOLD OUT icon for items with 0 stock at specific stores.
