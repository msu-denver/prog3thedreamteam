# Sprint Retrospective

Date/Time: 11/22/24

Participants: Full group

Creating the database took longer than was planned, so we ended up going a bit over the amount of time we had thought it would take. Sarah ended up helping Adam and Moe finish it. 

Because everyone has plans over Thanksgiving break, we will be putting a small hold on our progress until everyone is available.
